This folder is a little bit of a mess but here we go:

main_voronoi takes all the images in data2-albumin/All images/ , finds the branch
points from the skeleton of the original image, creates a voronoi diagram and
extracts:

the number of nodes, number of verticies, angular defect, ratio, number of 
polygons, average number of sides per polygon.

The data is then written into voronoi_params.

If any of the processes fail, the values are overwritten with -1.
